# This file is responsible for configuring your umbrella
# and **all applications** and their dependencies with the
# help of the Config module.
#
# Note that all applications in your umbrella share the
# same configuration and dependencies, which is why they
# all use the same configuration file. If you want different
# configurations or dependencies per app, it is best to
# move said applications out of the umbrella.

# Configures the mailer
#
# By default it uses the "Local" adapter which stores the emails
# locally. You can see the emails in your browser, at "/dev/mailbox".
#
# For production it's recommended to configure a different adapter
# at the `config/runtime.exs`.

# Sample configuration:

#     config :logger, :console,
#       level: :info,
#       format: "$date $time [$level] $metadata$message\n",
#       metadata: [:user_id]
#
# Configures Elixir's Logger
config :logger, :console,
  format: "$time $metadata[$level] $message\n",

# Import environment specific config. This must remain at the bottom
